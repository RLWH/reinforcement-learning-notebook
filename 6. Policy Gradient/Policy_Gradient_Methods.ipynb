    "# Policy Gradient Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, we have learnt almost all the methods that have been used action-value methods. They learned the values of actions and then selected actions based on their estimated action values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we canlearn a *parameterized policy* that can select actions without consulting a value function. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the optimal policies are not a deterministic policy. It can be a stochastic policy.\n",
    "- Using a parameterized policy can solve large-scale problem, as it uses approximation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Parameterized policy?\n",
    "A parameterized policy is a policy that takes in a parameter vector, denote as $\\vec{\\theta} \\in \\mathop{\\mathbb{R}}^{d'}$ for approximation. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Parameterized policy formal representation\n",

    "$\\pi(a|s, \\vec{\\theta}) = \\Pr\\{A_t=a | S_t=s, \\vec{\\theta}_t=\\vec{\\theta}\\}$\n",
    "for the probability that action $a$ is taken at time $t$, given that the environment is in state $s$ at time $t$ with parameter $\\vec{\\theta}$. \n",

    "## Why policy approximation?\n",
    "In practice, to ensure exploration, we generally require that the policy never becomes deterministic. \n",
